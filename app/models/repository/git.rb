  # With SCM's that have a sequential commit numbering, redmine is able to be

  # it knows about.  However, with git, you never know if people have merged
  # commits into the middle of the repository history, so we should parse
  # the entire log. But now we store last branches heads in scm_metadata serialized
  # field.
  # But if somebody rewrite some branch in git this could cause unpredictable problems.
  # The repository can still be fully reloaded by calling #clear_changesets
  # before fetching changesets (eg. for offline resync)

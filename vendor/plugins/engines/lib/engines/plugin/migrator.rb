# The Plugin::Migrator class contains the logic to run migrations from
# within plugin directories. The directory in which a plugin's migrations
# should be is determined by the Plugin#migration_directory method.
#
# To migrate a plugin, you can simple call the migrate method (Plugin#migrate)
# with the version number that plugin should be at. The plugin's migrations
# will then be used to migrate up (or down) to the given version.
#
# For more information, see Engines::RailsExtensions::Migrations
class Engines::Plugin::Migrator < ActiveRecord::Migrator

  # We need to be able to set the 'current' engine being migrated.

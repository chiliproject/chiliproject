Description:
  The upgrade engines migration performs any database alterations required to
  use engines 1.2.
  
  Currently, this is only the renaming of 'engines_schema_info' to 'plugin_schema_info'.

Example:
  ./script/generate upgrade_engines

  This will generate:

    RAILS_ROOT
      |- db
          |-migrate
              |- xxx_upgrade_engines_to_1.2.rb

  which contains the migrations to perform the changes described above.
